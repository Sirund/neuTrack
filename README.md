### Face Recognition Setup Guide
This guide will help you set up face recognition using Python and the `face_recognition` library.

To connect to the Raspberry Pi terminal, you have various options including VNC, SSH, or PuTTY. Open the terminal and execute each command by copying and pasting it into your Pi's terminal window. After pasting each command, press Enter and wait for it to complete before proceeding to the next one. If prompted with 'Do you want to continue? (y/n)', type 'Y' and then press Enter to proceed with the process.

```bash
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt install cmake build-essential pkg-config git

sudo apt install libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libpng-dev libwebp-dev libopenexr-dev

sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libdc1394-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev

sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libqt5gui5 libqt5webkit5 libqt5test5 python3-pyqt5

sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev liblapacke-dev gfortran

sudo apt install libhdf5-dev libhdf5-103

sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-numpy
```

We must now expand the swapfile before running the next set of commands. To do this type and enter into the Terminal the following line.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
```

The change the number on CONF_SWAPSIZE = 100 to CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048. Having done this press Ctrl-X, Y, and then Enter Key to save these changes. This change is only temporary and we will be changing it back. To have these changes affect anything we must restart the swapfile by entering the following command to the terminal. Then we will resume Terminal Commands as normal.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart dphys-swapfile

git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git

git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git

mkdir ~/opencv/build

cd ~/opencv/build

cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \

-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \

-D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_contrib/modules \

-D ENABLE_NEON=ON \

-D ENABLE_VFPV3=ON \

-D BUILD_TESTS=OFF \

-D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=OFF \

-D OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON \

-D CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-latomic \

-D BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF ..

make -j$(nproc)
```

This | make | Command will take over an hour to install and there will be no indication of how much longer it will take. It may also freeze the monitor display. Be ultra patient and it will work. Once complete you are most of the way done. Then we will resume terminal commands.
```bash
sudo make install

sudo ldconfig

pip install face-recognition --no-cache-dir
```

This | pip install face-recognition| Command will take over 40 mins to install and there will be no indication of how much longer it will take. Be ultra patient and it will work. Once complete you are most of the way done. Then we will resume terminal commands.
```bash
pip install imutils
```

We must now return the swapfile before running the next set of commands. To do this type into Terminal this line.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
```

The change the number on CONF_SWAPSIZE = 2048 to CONF_SWAPSIZE=100. Having done this press Ctrl-X, Y, and then Enter Key to save these changes. This returns the Swapfile to normal. To have these changes affect anything we must restart the swapfile by entering the following command to the terminal. Then we will resume terminal Commands as normal.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart dphys-swapfile
```

### GPS Setup Guide
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a GPS module on your Raspberry Pi.

#### Hardware Connections
Here are the connections for the NEO-6M GPS module with the Raspberry Pi:
| Raspberry Pi           | NEO-6M GPS Module   |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| 3.3V (Pin 1 or 17)     | VCC       |
| Ground (Pin 6 or 9 or 14) | GND    |
| TX (GPIO 14 - UART0_TXD) | RX     |
| RX (GPIO 15 - UART0_RXD) | TX (Not required in our case)|

#### Get Data From GPS
Now here we need to modify few things. At first we need to edit the /boot/config.txt file. Now you need to open this file in any text editor. Here I am using nano:
```bash
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
At the end of the file add the follwing lines:
```bash
dtparam=spi=on
dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt
core_freq=250
enable_uart=1
force_turbo=1
```
Now save this by typing ctrl +x, then type y and press enter.

Raspbian uses the UART as a serial console and so we need to turn off that functionality. To do so we need to change the /boot/cmdline.txt file. For safety before editing the file make a backup of that using the following command:
```bash
sudo cp /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt /boot/firmware/cmdline_backup.txt
```
Now to edit that file open that in text editor:
```bash
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
```
Replace the content with the follwing line (delete everything in it and write down the following content):
```bash
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet splash plymouth.igno
```
Now save this by typing ctrl +x, then type y and press enter.
Now reboot pi using:
```bash
sudo reboot
```
Now, before we write the Python code to retrieve GPS data, we need to set up a few things again. By default, the Raspberry Pi uses the serial port for "console" login. So, if we intend to use the serial port to receive data from the GPS module, we need to disable the console login. In Raspberry Pi 3, there are two serial ports: serial0 and serial1. However, serial0 is mapped to GPIO pins 14 and 15. Therefore, we'll be using serial0. To identify which port is associated with serial0, use the following command:
```bash
ls -l /dev
```

There are two possible outputs:
- If your output looks like this:
![s1](https://github.com/Sirund/neuTrack/assets/120204570/0f7396e0-73d4-4edb-96b0-a0c1a421088f)

As you can see serial0 is linked with ttyAMA0. So to disable the console you need to use the follwing commands:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service
sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service
```

- But if your output looks like this:
![s2](https://github.com/Sirund/neuTrack/assets/120204570/be3f101f-f309-43be-9643-ab76e9edc3d3)

That means serial0 is linked with ttyS0. So to disable the console you need to use the follwing commands:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service
```
Now we need to install a python library:
```bash
pip install pynmea2
```
